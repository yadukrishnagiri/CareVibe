## 🎯 What is CareVibe?

CareVibe is a demo application that allows patients to:
- Sign in securely using Google or Email/Password (Firebase Authentication)
- Chat with an AI health assistant powered by Groq AI
- Browse a list of nearby doctors
- View their appointments dashboard
- Access health insights and tips

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Android & Web)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** Firebase
- **AI Chat:** Groq API

---

## ✨ Key Features

- AI Assistant (Groq) with natural-language date parsing, intent detection, and adaptive, plain‑text responses
- Shared demo data via `DEMO_UID` so every login sees the same dataset (or point to your own Atlas data)
- Demo authentication bypass (`POST /auth/demo`) for quick testing without Firebase
- Day-focused Home: Health Score, contextual weather tips, medication reminders, and Today vs Yesterday comparisons
- Analytics with date range picker, reset, and PDF/CSV export (includes AI summary)
- Cloud-first API base for devices/emulators; web debug uses localhost automatically
- Startup connection checks (MongoDB, Groq, Firebase) logged on backend boot

## 🏗️ Architecture

- Flutter app → REST API (JWT)
- Backend verifies Firebase tokens (or demo auth), queries MongoDB Atlas
- AI pipeline uses templates + policy to ensure accurate numbers and concise tone
- API base selection in `frontend/lib/services/api.dart`:
  - Web (debug): `http://localhost:5000`
  - Non-web (devices/emulators): `https://carevibe-backend.onrender.com` (override with `--dart-define=API_BASE=`)

---

## 🧰 FixQL Toolkit

- Automation lives in `backend/fixql/`: `run-codeql.js` orchestrates CodeQL database creation, analysis, and prompt generation while `process-sarif.js` converts SARIF output into Groq-powered fix prompts.
- Run `node backend/fixql/run-codeql.js` (or `node backend/fixql/run-codeql.js --name demo`) to produce a database folder, SARIF file, and prompt drafts under `fixprompt/`.
- Process an existing SARIF file with `node backend/fixql/process-sarif.js demo.sarif -o fixprompt/demo-prompts`.
- `fixprompt/` is tracked via `.gitkeep` and the rest of its markdown output stays locally ignored so prompt drafts are never accidentally committed; the GitHub workflow instead keeps the folder placeholder mentionable in docs.

6. **Remember this path!** You'll need it in Step 4.

---

### Step 4: Set Up Backend (Node.js)

#### 4.1 Install Backend Dependencies
1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the backend folder:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\yaduk\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\CareVibe\backend
   ```
2. Install all required packages:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
   This will take a few minutes. Wait for it to finish.

#### 4.2 Create Backend Environment File
1. In the `backend` folder, you should see a file called `env.example`
2. Copy this file and rename it to `.env` (yes, starting with a dot!)
   - **Windows:** You can do this in PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     copy env.example .env
     ```
3. Open `.env` file with Notepad or VS Code
4. Fill in the values (replace the placeholders):

   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/patient_ai_demo
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_to_something_random
   AES_KEY=32characterslongsecretkey!!
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\CareVibe\firebase-admin-key.json
   PORT=5000
   ```

   **Important Notes:**
   - Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key
   - Replace `C:\CareVibe\firebase-admin-key.json` with the actual path where you saved your Firebase Admin SDK JSON file
   - Replace `your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_to_something_random` with any random string (like `mySecretKey123!@#`)
   - For `AES_KEY`, use exactly 32 characters (e.g., `12345678901234567890123456789012`)
   - For cloud deployment, set `MONGO_URI` to your MongoDB Atlas connection string (Step 7)

5. Save the `.env` file

#### 4.3 Test Backend Connection
1. Start the backend server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
2. You should see: `API up` or `Server running on port 5000`
3. Open a browser and go to: http://localhost:5000/health
4. You should see: `{"ok":true}`
5. **Keep this PowerShell window open!** The backend must keep running.

#### 4.4 Test Groq API Connection (Optional but Recommended)
1. Open a **NEW** PowerShell window
2. Navigate to backend folder:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\yaduk\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\CareVibe\backend
   ```
3. Run:
   ```powershell
   npm run test:groq
   ```
4. If you see "✅ Groq API responded successfully", you're good!
5. If you see an error, check your `GROQ_API_KEY` in the `.env` file

---

### Step 5: Set Up Weather API (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Copy weather service template:**
   ```powershell
   cd frontend\lib\services
   copy weather_service.template.dart weather_service.dart
   ```

2. **Get OpenWeatherMap API key:**
   - Go to: https://openweathermap.org/
   - Sign up for free account
   - Go to "My API Keys" section
   - Copy your API key

3. **Add API key to weather service:**
   - Open `frontend\lib\services\weather_service.dart`
   - Find line 20: `static const String _apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';`
   - Replace with your actual key
   - Save the file

4. **Wait for activation:**
   - API keys take 10-15 minutes to activate

**Note:** The actual `weather_service.dart` is in `.gitignore` for security. See `frontend/lib/services/WEATHER_SETUP.md` for details.

---

### Step 6: Set Up Frontend (Flutter)

#### 6.1 Install Flutter Dependencies
1. Open a **NEW** PowerShell window (keep backend running!)
2. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\yaduk\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\CareVibe\frontend
   ```
3. Install Flutter packages:
   ```powershell
   flutter pub get
   ```
   Wait for it to finish.

#### 6.2 Add Firebase Configuration File
1. Copy the `google-services.json` file you downloaded from Firebase
2. Paste it into: `frontend\android\app\google-services.json`
3. Make sure the file path is exactly: `frontend\android\app\google-services.json`

#### 6.3 Configure Firebase for Flutter (Web Support)
1. Make sure you have FlutterFire CLI installed:
   ```powershell
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```
2. Add FlutterFire CLI to PATH (for current session):
   ```powershell
   $env:PATH += ";$env:LocalAppData\Pub\Cache\bin"
   ```
3. From the `frontend` folder, run:
   ```powershell
   flutterfire configure
   ```
4. Follow the prompts:
   - Select your Firebase project
   - Select platforms: `android`, `web`
   - This will generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` automatically

#### 6.4 Verify Flutter Setup
1. Run Flutter doctor to check everything:
   ```powershell
   flutter doctor
   ```
2. Fix any issues it reports (usually related to Android SDK or licenses)

---

### Step 7: Run the Application

#### Option A: Run on Web (Easier for Beginners)

1. **Make sure backend is running** (Step 4.3)
2. Open PowerShell in the `frontend` folder:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\yaduk\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\CareVibe\frontend
   ```
3. Run the Flutter web app:
   ```powershell
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```
4. Wait for the app to compile and open in Chrome
5. Sign in with Google or Email/Password
6. Start using the app!

#### Option B: Run on Android Emulator

1. **Start Android Emulator:**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to Tools → Device Manager
   - Click "Create Device" if you don't have one
   - Start an emulator (API 30 or higher recommended)

2. **Make sure backend is running** (Step 4.3)

3. **Run Flutter app:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\yaduk\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\CareVibe\frontend
   flutter run
   ```
   Or specify device:
   ```powershell
   flutter run -d <device-id>
   ```
   (Find device ID with: `flutter devices`)

---

### Step 8: Deploy to the Cloud & Build the APK

Want the app to run on a real phone without your laptop on? Deploy the backend to Render (free tier) and point the Flutter app to that URL.

#### 8.1 Deploy backend to Render.com
1. Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com) with your GitHub account.
2. Click **New → Web Service** and choose the `yadukrishnagiri/CareVibe` repository.
3. Use these settings:
   - **Root Directory:** `backend`
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm run start`
   - **Instance Type:** Free
4. In the **Environment** section add your secrets:
   - `MONGO_URI` → Atlas connection string (with password encoded, e.g. `%40` for `@`)
   - `JWT_SECRET`, `AES_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` → `/etc/secrets/firebase-admin-key.json`
5. In **Secret Files**, create `firebase-admin-key.json` and paste your Firebase Admin SDK JSON.
6. Click **Deploy web service**.

#### 8.2 Whitelist Render in MongoDB Atlas
1. In MongoDB Atlas go to **Security → Network Access**.
2. Add IP `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all) or the specific Render IPs.
3. Wait until the status shows **Active** and redeploy if needed.

#### 8.3 Update Flutter to use the cloud API
1. Open `frontend/lib/services/api.dart`.
2. Replace the `apiBase` value with your Render URL, e.g.
   ```dart
   const String apiBase = 'https://carevibe-backend.onrender.com';
   ```
3. (Optional) commit and push the change to GitHub so future deploys use it.

#### 8.4 Build the release APK
1. In PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\yaduk\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\CareVibe\frontend
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
   ```
2. APK output: `frontend\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`

#### 8.5 Install on a real device
- Copy the APK to your phone and open it, or run:
  ```powershell
  adb install frontend\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk
  ```
- Sign in with Google, open AI chat, doctors, dashboard — everything now uses the Render backend.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Backend `.env` (use `backend/env.example` as a template):

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster..../patient_ai_demo
DEMO_UID=demo-shared
JWT_SECRET=<random-strong-string>
AES_KEY=<32-characters>
GROQ_API_KEY=<your-groq-api-key>
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account",...}  # preferred in cloud
# or
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/etc/secrets/firebase-admin-key.json
PORT=5000
```

Frontend API base is auto-selected in `frontend/lib/services/api.dart` (see Architecture above).

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Problem:** `Cannot find module` error
- **Solution:** Run `npm install` in the `backend` folder

**Problem:** `MongoDB connection failed`
- **Solution:** Make sure MongoDB service is running (check Services)

**Problem:** `Firebase verification failed`
- **Solution:** Check `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path in `.env` file. Make sure the file exists and path is correct.

**Problem:** `GROQ_API_KEY` error
- **Solution:** Check your `.env` file. Make sure `GROQ_API_KEY` has a value (no spaces around the `=` sign)

**Problem:** Port 5000 already in use
- **Solution:** Change `PORT=5000` to `PORT=5001` in `.env` file, then update `frontend/lib/services/api.dart` to use port 5001

### Frontend Issues

**Problem:** `google-services.json` not found
- **Solution:** Make sure the file is at `frontend\android\app\google-services.json`

**Problem:** Flutter build fails
- **Solution:** Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`

**Problem:** Firebase authentication doesn't work
- **Solution:** 
  - Verify `google-services.json` is in the correct location
  - Check SHA fingerprints are added in Firebase Console
  - Re-download `google-services.json` after adding fingerprints

**Problem:** Can't connect to backend API
- **Solution:** 
  - If running locally: start the backend with `npm run dev`
  - For web (local): backend should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`
  - For Android emulator (local): backend should be accessible at `http://10.0.2.2:5000`
  - For Render deployment: open `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/health` and confirm `{"ok":true}`
  - Ensure `frontend/lib/services/api.dart` points to the same URL you just verified

**Problem:** AI chat shows "AI service unavailable"
- **Solution:** 
  - Check your `GROQ_API_KEY` in backend `.env` file
  - Run `npm run test:groq` in backend folder to test Groq connection
  - Check backend console logs for detailed error messages

### General Issues

**Problem:** PowerShell commands not recognized
- **Solution:** Make sure you're using PowerShell (not CMD). Some commands require PowerShell.

**Problem:** Flutter doctor shows issues
- **Solution:** Follow the instructions `flutter doctor` provides. Usually involves:
  - Accepting Android licenses: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`
  - Installing missing SDK components in Android Studio

## 🔒 Security & Code Quality

- Code scanning with GitHub CodeQL is enabled for the Node backend. It runs on pushes/PRs to `main` and weekly.
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (scopes analysis to `backend/` via `./.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`).
- View results: GitHub → Security → Code scanning alerts.

## 🗂️ Documentation Folder (ignored by Git)

- The `docs/` folder is ignored by Git to keep the repository lean for app code.
- If docs were previously committed, untrack them (files stay locally):
  ```powershell
  git rm -r --cached docs
  git commit -m "chore: stop tracking docs/"
  git push
  ```
- Want to keep specific files tracked? Remove `docs/` from `.gitignore` and add explicit ignores (e.g., `docs/*.md` except one file), or add a `.gitignore` inside `docs/` to fine-tune.

---
